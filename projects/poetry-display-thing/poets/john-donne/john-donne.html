        <h3>Additional Section</h3>
        <p>John Donne (1571/72–1631) was a pioneering English poet and cleric whose work epitomizes the metaphysical tradition. Born into a recusant Catholic family during a time of religious persecution, Donne's early life was marked by intellectual rigor and personal hardship. He studied at Oxford and Cambridge but couldn't obtain degrees due to his faith, and later converted to Anglicanism, a move that facilitated his career advancement. Donne's poetry is renowned for its intricate metaphysical conceits, blending intellectual playfulness with deep emotional insight. His early works often explore themes of love and desire, characterized by wit and sensuality. Following personal tragedies and a shift in spiritual focus, his later writings delve into themes of mortality and divine love, reflecting his role as Dean of St. Paul's Cathedral.</p>
