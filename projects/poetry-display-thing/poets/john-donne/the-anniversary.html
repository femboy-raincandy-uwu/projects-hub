    <p>

        All Kings, and all their favourites, <br>
        All glory of honours, beauties, wits, <br>
   The sun itself, which makes times, as they pass, <br>
   Is elder by a year now than it was <br>
   When thou and I first one another saw: <br>
   All other things to their destruction draw, <br>
        Only our love hath no decay; <br>
   This no tomorrow hath, nor yesterday, <br>
   Running it never runs from us away, <br>
But truly keeps his first, last, everlasting day. <br>
<br>
        Two graves must hide thine and my corse; <br>
        If one might, death were no divorce. <br>
   Alas, as well as other Princes, we <br>
   (Who Prince enough in one another be) <br>
   Must leave at last in death these eyes and ears, <br>
   Oft fed with true oaths, and with sweet salt tears; <br>
        But souls where nothing dwells but love <br>
   (All other thoughts being inmates) then shall prove <br>
   This, or a love increasèd there above, <br>
When bodies to their graves, souls from their graves remove. <br>
<br>
        And then we shall be throughly blessed; <br>
        But we no more than all the rest. <br>
   Here upon earth we’re Kings, and none but we <br>
   Can be such Kings, nor of such subjects be; <br>
   Who is so safe as we? where none can do <br>
   Treason to us, except one of us two. <br>
        True and false fears let us refrain, <br>
   Let us love nobly, and live, and add again <br>
   Years and years unto years, till we attain <br>
To write threescore: this is the second of our reign. <br>
