    <h1>The Flea</h1>
    <h2>John Donne</h2>
</header>
    <p>

        Mark but this flea, and mark in this,   <br>
        How little that which thou deniest me is;  <br> 
        It sucked me first, and now sucks thee,<br>
        And in this flea our two bloods mingled be;   <br>
        Thou know’st that this cannot be said<br>
        A sin, nor shame, nor loss of maidenhead,<br>
            Yet this enjoys before it woo,<br>
            And pampered swells with one blood made of two,<br>
            And this, alas, is more than we would do.<br>
            <br>
        Oh stay, three lives in one flea spare,<br>
        Where we almost, nay more than married are.   <br>
        This flea is you and I, and this<br>
        Our marriage bed, and marriage temple is;   <br>
        Though parents grudge, and you, w'are met,   <br>
        And cloistered in these living walls of jet.<br>
            Though use make you apt to kill me,<br>
            Let not to that, self-murder added be,<br>
            And sacrilege, three sins in killing three.<br>
            <br>
        Cruel and sudden, hast thou since<br>
        Purpled thy nail, in blood of innocence?   <br>
        Wherein could this flea guilty be,<br>
        Except in that drop which it sucked from thee?   <br>
        Yet thou triumph’st, and say'st that thou   <br>
        Find’st not thy self, nor me the weaker now;<br>
            ’Tis true; then learn how false, fears be:<br>
            Just so much honor, when thou yield’st to me,<br>
            Will waste, as this flea’s death took life from thee.<br>
            <br>
