            1.
            <br>
            I watched thee when the foe was at our side, <br>
            Ready to strike at him—or thee and me, <br>
            Were safety hopeless—rather than divide <br>
            Aught with one loved save love and liberty. <br>
            <br>
            2. <br>
            
            I watched thee on the breakers, when the rock <br>
            Received our prow, and all was storm and fear, <br>
            And bade thee cling to me through every shock; <br>
            This arm would be thy bark, or breast thy bier. <br>
            <br>
            3.<br>
            
            I watched thee when the fever glazed thine eyes, <br>
            Yielding my couch and stretched me on the ground <br>
            When overworn with watching, ne’er to rise <br>
            From thence if thou an early grave hadst found. <br>
            <br>
            4.<br>
            
            The earthquake came, and rocked the quivering wall, <br>
            And men and nature reeled as if with wine. <br>
            Whom did I seek around the tottering hall? <br>
            For thee. Whose safety first provide for? Thine. <br>
            <br>
            5.<br>
            
            And when convulsive throes denied my breath <br>
            The faintest utterance to my fading thought, <br>
            To thee—to thee—e’en in the gasp of death <br>
            My spirit turned, oh! oftener than it ought. <br>
            <br>
            6.<br>
            
            Thus much and more; and yet thou lov’st me not, <br>
            And never wilt! Love dwells not in our will. <br>
            Nor can I blame thee, though it be my lot <br>
            To strongly, wrongly, vainly love thee still. <br>
