        <h3>Life Summary</h3>
            <p>Lord Byron (1788–1824), a leading figure of the Romantic movement, lived a life marked by literary brilliance, scandal, and defiance of societal norms. Celebrated for works like *Don Juan* and *Childe Harold's Pilgrimage*, he captivated audiences with his poetic talent and charismatic persona. Byron's personal life was equally complex; he engaged in relationships with both men and women, including a notable affair with John Edleston during his time at Trinity College, Cambridge . His openness about his sexuality, in an era when homosexuality was criminalized, contributed to his controversial reputation and eventual exile from England in 1816 . Byron spent his later years in Italy and Greece, where he supported the Greek War of Independence. He died of fever in 1824 at the age of 36, leaving behind a legacy as a revolutionary poet and a symbol of romantic and sexual nonconformity. </p></div>
