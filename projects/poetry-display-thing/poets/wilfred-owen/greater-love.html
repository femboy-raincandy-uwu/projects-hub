            Red lips are not so red <br>
            As the stained stones kissed by the English dead. <br>
            Kindness of wooed and wooer <br>
            Seems shame to their love pure. <br>
            O Love, your eyes lose lure <br>
            When I behold eyes blinded in my stead! <br>
            <br>
            Your slender attitude <br>
            Trembles not exquisite like limbs knife-skewed, <br>
            Rolling and rolling there <br>
            Where God seems not to care; <br>
            Till the fierce love they bear <br>
            Cramps them in death's extreme decrepitude. <br>
            <br>
            Your voice sings not so soft,- <br>
            Though even as wind murmuring through raftered loft,- <br>
            Your dear voice is not dear, <br>
            Gentle, and evening clear, <br>
            As theirs whom none now hear, <br>
            Now earth has stopped their piteous mouths that coughed. <br>
            <br>
            Heart, you were never hot <br>
            Nor large, nor full like hearts made great with shot; <br>
            And though your hand be pale, <br>
            Paler are all which trail <br>
            Your cross through flame and hail: <br>
            Weep, you may weep, for you may touch them not. <br>
