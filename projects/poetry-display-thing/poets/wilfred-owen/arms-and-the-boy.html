          <p>
            Let the boy try along this bayonet-blade <br>
            How cold steel is, and keen with hunger of blood; <br>
            Blue with all malice, like a madman's flash; <br>
            And thinly drawn with famishing for flesh. <br>
            <br>
            Lend him to stroke these blind, blunt bullet-leads,  <br>
            Which long to nuzzle in the hearts of lads,  <br>
            Or give him cartridges of fine zinc teeth  <br>
            Sharp with the sharpness of grief and death. <br>
            <br>
            For his teeth seem for laughing round an apple. <br>
            There lurk no claws behind his fingers supple; <br>
            And God will grow no talons at his heels, <br>
            Nor antlers through the thickness of his curls. <br>
