            The beautiful, the fair, the elegant, <br>
            Is that which pleases us, says Kant, <br>
            Without a thought of interest or advantage. <br>
            <br>
            I used to watch men when they spoke of beauty <br>
            And measure their enthusiasm. One <br>
            An old man, seeing a ( ) setting sun, <br>
            Praised it ( ) a certain sense of duty <br>
            To the calm evening and his time of life. <br>
            I know another man that never says a Beauty <br>
            But of a horse; ( ) <br>
            <br>
            Men seldom speak of beauty, beauty as such, <br>
            Not even lovers think about it much. <br>
            Women of course consider it for hours <br>
            In mirrors; ( ) <br>
            <br>
            A shrapnel ball - <br>
            Just where the wet skin glistened when he swam - <br>
            Like a fully-opened sea-anemone. <br>
            We both said 'What a beauty! What a beauty, lad' <br>
            I knew that in that flower he saw a hope <br>
            Of living on, and seeing again the roses of his home. <br>
            Beauty is that which pleases and delights, <br>
            Not bringing personal advantage - Kant. <br>
            But later on I heard <br>
            A canker worked into that crimson flower <br>
            And that he sank with it <br>
            And laid it with the anemones off Dover. <br>
