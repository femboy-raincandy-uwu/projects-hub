          <p>
            It was a navy boy, so prim, so trim, <br>
That boarded my compartment of the train. <br>
I shared my cigarettes and books to him. <br>
He shared his heart to me. (Who knows my gain!) <br>
(His head was golden like the oranges <br>
That catch their brightness from Las Palmas sun.) <br>
'O whence and whither bound, lad?' 'Home,' he says, <br>
'Home, from Hong Kong, sir, and a ten months' run.' <br>
(His blouse was all as blue as morning sea, <br>
His face was fresh like dawn above that blue.) <br>
'I got one letter, sir, just one,' says he, <br>
'And no shore-leave out there, sir, for the crew.' <br>
(His look was noble as a good ship's prow <br>
And all of him was clean as pure east wind.) <br>
'I am no ""sir"", I said, 'but tell me now <br>
What carried you? Not tea, nor tamarind?' <br>
Strong were his silken muscles hiddenly <br>
As under currents where the waters smile. <br>
'Nitre we carried. By next week maybe <br>
That should be winning France another mile.' <br>
His words were shapely, even as his lips, <br>
And courtesy he used like any lord. <br>
'Was it through books that you first thought of ships?' <br>
'Reading a book, sir, made me go aboard.' <br>
'Another hour and I'll be home,' he said. <br>
(His eyes were happy even as his heart.) <br>
'Twenty-five pounds I'm taking home,' he said, <br>
'It's five miles there; and I shall run, best part.' <br>
And as we talked, some things he said to me <br>
Not knowing, cleansed me of a cowardice, <br>
As I had braced me in the dangerous sea. <br>
Yet I should scarce have told it but for this. <br>
'Those pounds,' I said. 'You'll put some twenty by?' <br>
'All for my mother, sir.' And turned his head. <br>
'Why all?' I asked, in pain that he should sigh: <br>
'Because I must. She needs it most,' he said. <br>
