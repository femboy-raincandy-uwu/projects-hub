          <p>
            Sweet is your antique body, not yet young. <br>
            Beauty withheld from youth that looks for youth. <br>
            Fair only for your father. Dear among <br>
            Masters in art. To all men else uncouth <br>
            Save me; who know your smile comes very old, <br>
            Learnt of the happy dead that laughed with gods; <br>
            For earlier suns than ours have lent you gold, <br>
            Sly fauns and trees have given you jigs and nods. <br>
            But soon your heart, hot-beating like a bird's, <br>
            Shall slow down. Youth shall lop your hair, <br>
            And you must learn wry meanings in our words. <br>
            Your smile shall dull, because too keen aware; <br>
            And when for hopes your hand shall be uncurled, <br>
            Your eyes shall close, being opened to the world. <br>
