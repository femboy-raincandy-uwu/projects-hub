            Does it matter?-losing your legs? <br>
For people will always be kind, <br>
And you need not show that you mind <br>
When others come in after hunting <br>
To gobble their muffins and eggs. <br>
Does it matter?-losing your sight? <br>
There’s such splendid work for the blind; <br>
And people will always be kind, <br>
As you sit on the terrace remembering <br>
And turning your face to the light. <br>
Do they matter-those dreams in the pit? <br>
You can drink and forget and be glad, <br>
And people won't say that you’re mad; <br>
For they know that you've fought for your country, <br>
And no one will worry a bit. <br>
