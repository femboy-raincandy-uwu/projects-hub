            'Jack fell as he'd have wished,' the mother said, <br>
            And folded up the letter that she'd read. <br>
            'The Colonel writes so nicely.' Something broke <br>
            In the tired voice that quavered to a choke. <br>
            She half looked up. 'We mothers are so proud <br>
            Of our dead soldiers.' Then her face was bowed. <br>
            <br>
            Quietly the Brother Officer went out. <br>
            He'd told the poor old dear some gallant lies <br>
            That she would nourish all her days, no doubt <br>
            For while he coughed and mumbled, her weak eyes <br>
            Had shone with gentle triumph, brimmed with joy, <br>
            Because he'd been so brave, her glorious boy. <br>
            <br>
            He thought how 'Jack', cold-footed, useless swine, <br>
            Had panicked down the trench that night the mine <br>
            Went up at Wicked Corner; how he'd tried <br>
            To get sent home, and how, at last, he died, <br>
            Blown to small bits. And no one seemed to care <br>
            Except that lonely woman with white hair. <br>
