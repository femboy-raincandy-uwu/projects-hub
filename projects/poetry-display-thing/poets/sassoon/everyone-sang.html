            Everyone suddenly burst out singing; <br>
            And I was filled with such delight <br>
            As prisoned birds must find in freedom, <br>
            Winging wildly across the white <br>
            Orchards and dark-green fields; on—on—and out of sight. <br>
            <br>
            Everyone's voice was suddenly lifted; <br>
            And beauty came like the setting sun: <br>
            My heart was shaken with tears; and horror <br>
            Drifted away… O, but Everyone <br>
            Was a bird; and the song was wordless; <br>
            the singing will never be done. <br>
