            No doubt they’ll soon get well; the shock and strain  <br>
            Have caused their stammering, disconnected talk.  <br>
          Of course they’re ‘longing to go out again,’—  <br>
            These boys with old, scared faces, learning to walk.  <br>
          They’ll soon forget their haunted nights; their cowed  <br>
            Subjection to the ghosts of friends who died,—  <br>
          Their dreams that drip with murder; and they’ll be proud  <br>
            Of glorious war that shatter’d all their pride…  <br>
          Men who went out to battle, grim and glad;  <br>
          Children, with eyes that hate you, broken and mad. <br>
