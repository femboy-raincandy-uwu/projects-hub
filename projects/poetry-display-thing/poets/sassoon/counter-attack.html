            We’d gained our first objective hours before  <br>
            While dawn broke like a face with blinking eyes,    <br>
            Pallid, unshaved and thirsty, blind with smoke.    <br>
            Things seemed all right at first. We held their line,    <br>
            With bombers posted, Lewis guns well placed,          <br>
            And clink of shovels deepening the shallow trench.    <br>
             The place was rotten with dead; green clumsy legs    <br>
             High-booted, sprawled and grovelled along the saps    <br>
             And trunks, face downward, in the sucking mud,    <br>
             Wallowed like trodden sand-bags loosely filled;    <br>
             And naked sodden buttocks, mats of hair,    <br>
             Bulged, clotted heads slept in the plastering slime.    <br>
             And then the rain began,—the jolly old rain!    <br>
             <br>
            A yawning soldier knelt against the bank,    <br>
            Staring across the morning blear with fog;    <br>
            He wondered when the Allemands would get busy;    <br>
            And then, of course, they started with five-nines    <br>
            Traversing, sure as fate, and never a dud.    <br>
            Mute in the clamour of shells he watched them burst    <br>
            Spouting dark earth and wire with gusts from hell,    <br>
            While posturing giants dissolved in drifts of smoke.    <br>
            He crouched and flinched, dizzy with galloping fear,    <br>
            Sick for escape,—loathing the strangled horror    <br>
            And butchered, frantic gestures of the dead.    <br>
            <br>
            An officer came blundering down the trench:    <br>
            ‘Stand-to and man the fire-step!’ On he went…    <br>
            Gasping and bawling, ‘Fire-step… counter-attack!’    <br>
             Then the haze lifted. Bombing on the right    <br>
             Down the old sap: machine-guns on the left;    <br>
             And stumbling figures looming out in front.    <br>
             ‘O Christ, they’re coming at us!’ Bullets spat,    <br>
            And he remembered his rifle… rapid fire…    <br>
            And started blazing wildly… then a bang    <br>
            Crumpled and spun him sideways, knocked him out    <br>
            To grunt and wriggle: none heeded him; he choked    <br>
            And fought the flapping veils of smothering gloom,    <br>
            Lost in a blurred confusion of yells and groans…    <br>
            Down, and down, and down, he sank and drowned,    <br>
            Bleeding to death. The counter-attack had failed.  <br>
