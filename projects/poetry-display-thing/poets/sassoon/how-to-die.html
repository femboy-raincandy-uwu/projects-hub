          <p>
            Dark clouds are smouldering into red <br>
  While down the craters morning burns.  <br>
The dying soldier shifts his head  <br>
  To watch the glory that returns;  <br>
He lifts his fingers toward the skies       <br> 
  Where holy brightness breaks in flame;  <br>
Radiance reflected in his eyes,  <br>
  And on his lips a whispered name.  <br>
  <br>
You’d think, to hear some people talk,  <br>
  That lads go West with sobs and curses,  <br>
And sullen faces white as chalk,  <br>
  Hankering for wreaths and tombs and hearses.  <br>
But they’ve been taught the way to do it  <br>
  Like Christian soldiers; not with haste  <br>
And shuddering groans; but passing through it  <br>
  With due regard for decent taste. <br>
