          <p>
            You love us when we're heroes, home on leave, <br>
            Or wounded in a mentionable place. <br>
You worship decorations; you believe <br>
That chivalry redeems the war's disgrace. <br>
You make us shells. You listen with delight, <br>
By tales of dirt and danger fondly thrilled. <br>
You crown our distant ardours while we fight, <br>
And mourn our laurelled memories when we're killed. <br>
You can't believe that British troops 'retire' <br>
When hell's last horror breaks them, and they run, <br>
Trampling the terrible corpsesâ€”blind with blood. <br>
O German mother dreaming by the fire, <br>
While you are knitting socks to send your son <br>
His face is trodden deeper in the mud.<br>
